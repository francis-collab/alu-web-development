# ALU Web Development Project

This project contains basic HTML files demonstrating the structure and content of a simple website. The tasks include creating a basic HTML file, adding content to create a webpage, embedding tweets, and ensuring consistency across multiple pages.

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- No external libraries are allowed. The website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Code should be W3C compliant and validated with the W3C-Validator.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Structure

Create a basic HTML file called `base_index.html` with the following structure:
- DOCTYPE declaration
- Head section with a title
- Body section

### Task 1: Make a Cool First Webpage

Copy `base_index.html` to `index.html` and add the following elements:
- At least 4 paragraphs
- Headings of level 1, 2, and 3
- A clickable image that links to any URL

### Task 2: Make a Cool Other Webpage

Create `tweets.html` with the following elements:
- Embed at least one tweet
- A link to `index.html` for navigation
- Add a link to `tweets.html` in `index.html`

### Task 3: Make a Cool Website

Ensure consistency across `index.html` and `tweets.html` with the following structure:
- `<header>` containing an unordered list of links to each webpage
- `<main>` containing `<article>` and `<aside>` tags
- `<footer>` containing a paragraph with the sentence "Made by Francis Mutabazi"
