# ALU Web Development Project - Advanced HTML

This project focuses on implementing a webpage from a designer file using pure HTML semantic structure. No CSS or styling is included in this project. The designer file is available on Figma.

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- No external libraries are allowed. The website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Code should be W3C compliant and validated with the W3C-Validator.

## Tasks

### Task 0: README and Objectives

For this task, I will create a `README.md` file and outline the objectives of the project. The focus is on the HTML structure only, without any CSS or styling.

### Designer File

The designer file is available on https://www.figma.com/. You can access the final result [here](https://www.figma.com/files). To have access to all design details, "Duplicate to your Drafts" in Figma.

### Important Notes with Figma

- If your computer doesnâ€™t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/spin-cycle).
- Some values are in float - feel free to round them.
